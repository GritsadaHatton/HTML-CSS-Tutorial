All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

<!-- Example Basic HTML -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

</body>
</html>

<!-- Heading and Paragraph Explaination -->
